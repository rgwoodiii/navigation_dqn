As part of the Deep reinforcement learning nano degree with Udacity, this is an implementation of the DQN algorithm to train an agent how to optimally maximize yellow banana collection.

## environment details
For any reinforcement learning implementation, the agent has to interact with their environment. In this case, the environment is represented as a large square floor with blue and yellow bananas scattered throughout. 

### rewards
Per the agent's action, the agent is rewarded according to banana collection; -1 for a blue banana collected and +1 for a yellow banana collected.

### action space
Within the environment, there is a discrete action space of 4. At any point in time, the agent is able 1. move forward, 2. move right, 3. move backwards, or 4. move left.

### task success
In order to successfully complete our episodic task, the agent is required to obtain an average scoreÂ of at least 13 bananas over 100 episodes.
