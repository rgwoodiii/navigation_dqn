As part of the Deep reinforcement learning nano degree with Udacity, this is an implementation of the DQN algorithm to train an agent how to optimally maximize yellow banana collection.

## environment details
For any reinforcement learning implementation, the agent has to interact with their environment. In this case, the environment is represented as a large square floor with blue and yellow bananas scattered throughout. Per the agent's action given a preceding state, the agent is rewarded according to banana collection-- -1 for a blue banana collected and +1 for a yellow banana collected.
